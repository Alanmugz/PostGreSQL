	About (http://www.postgresql.org/about/)

	- PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.
	- To date over 15 year of active development
	- Designed by Michael Stonebraker at the University of California
	- It runs on all major operating systems
	- It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including 
	  INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. 
	- It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video
	- The PostgreSQL project aims to fully support a major release for five years.
	
	- There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 4 
	  terabytes of data
	
	  Limit	                     Value
	  Maximum Database Size	     Unlimited
	  Maximum Table Size	     32 TB
	  Maximum Row Size	         1.6 TB
	  Maximum Field Size	     1 GB
	  Maximum Rows per Table	 Unlimited
	  Maximum Columns per Table	 250 - 1600 depending on column types
	  Maximum Indexes per Table	 Unlimited
	  
	- It has full support for subqueries (including subselects in the FROM clause)
	
	- Data integrity features include (compound) primary keys, foreign keys with restricting and 
	  cascading updates/deletes, check constraints, unique constraints, and not null constraints.
	  
	- It also has a host of extensions and advanced features. Among the conveniences are 
	  auto-increment columns through sequences,and LIMIT/OFFSET allowing the return of partial 
	  result sets. PostgreSQL supports compound, unique, partial, and functional indexes which can 
	  use any of its B-tree, R-tree, hash, or GiST storage methods.
	  
	- Other advanced features include table inheritance, a rules systems, and database events. 
	  Table inheritance puts an object oriented slant on table creation, allowing database designers
	  to derive new tables from other tables, treating them as base classes. Even better, PostgreSQL
	  supports both single and multiple inheritance in this manner.
	  
	- The rules system, also called the query rewrite system, allows the database designer to create
   	  rules which identify specific operations for a given table or view, and dynamically transform 
	  them into alternate operations when they are processed.
	
	- The events system is an interprocess communication system in which messages and events can be 
	  transmitted between clients using the LISTEN and NOTIFY commands, allowing both simple peer 
	  to peer communication and advanced coordination on database events. Since notifications can 
	  be issued from triggers and stored procedures, PostgreSQL clients can monitor database events 
	  such as table updates, inserts, or deletes as they happen.
	  
	- PostgreSQL runs stored procedures in more than a dozen programming languages, including Java, 
	  Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, C/C++, and its own PL/pgSQL, which is similar to Oracle's PL/SQL. 
	  Included with its standard function library are hundreds of built-in functions that range 
	  from basic math and string operations to cryptography
	  
	- Triggers and stored procedures can be written in C and loaded into the database as a library, 
	  allowing great flexibility in extending its capabilities
	
	- PostgreSQL includes a framework that allows developers to define and create their own custom 
	  data types along with supporting functions and operators that define their behavior. As a 
	  result, a host of advanced data types have been created that range from geometric and spatial 
	  primitives to network addresses to even ISBN/ISSN (International Standard Book 
	  Number/International Standard Serial Number) data types, all of which can be optionally 
	  added to the system.
	  
	- Best of all, PostgreSQL's source code is available under a liberal open source license: the 
	  PostgreSQL License. This license gives you the freedom to use, modify and distribute 
	  PostgreSQL in any form you like, open or closed source. Any modifications, enhancements,or 
	  changes you make are yours to do with as you please. As such, PostgreSQL is not only a 
	  powerful database system capable of the enterprise, it is a development platform upon which 
	  to develop in-house, web, or commercial software products that require a capable RDBMS
   
	Immunity to over-deployment (http://www.postgresql.org/about/advantages/)
	
	- Over-deployment is what some proprietary database vendors regard as their #1 licence 
	  compliance problem.  With PostgreSQL, no-one can sue you for breaking licensing agreements, 
	  as there is no associated licensing cost for the software.

	  This has several additional advantages:

		<> More profitable business models with wide-scale deployment.
		<> No possibility of being audited for license compliance at any stage.
		<> Flexibility to do concept research and trial deployments without needing to include 
		   additional licensing costs.
		   
    Significant saving on staffing costs

	- Our software has been designed and created to have much lower maintenance and tuning 
	  requirements than the leading proprietary databases, yet still retain all of the features, 
	  stability, and performance.

	- In addition to this, our training programs are generally regarded as being far more cost 
	  effective, manageable, and practical in the real world than that of the leading proprietary 
	  database vendors.
		
	Legendary reliability and stability

	- Unlike many proprietary databases, it is extremely common for companies to report that 
	  PostgreSQL has never, ever crashed for them in several years of high activity operation.  
	  Not even once.  It just works.
	  
	Extensible

	- The source code is available to all at no charge.  If your staff have a need to customise 
	  or extend PostgreSQL in any way then they are able to do so with a minimum of effort, and 
	  with no attached costs.  This is complemented by the community of PostgreSQL professionals 
	  and enthusiasts around the globe that also actively extend PostgreSQL on a daily basis.
	  
	Designed for high volume environments

	- We use a multiple row data storage strategy called MVCC to make PostgreSQL extremely 
	  responsive in high volume environments.  The leading proprietary database vendor uses this 
	  technology as well, for the same reasons.
